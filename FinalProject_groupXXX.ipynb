    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core, this project explores the many capabilities of machine learning and heirarchical clustering. Fashion styles, more specifically with regards to shoes in this context, are popular ways for people to express themselves in modern society. With AI being the hot topic being discussed as well, it should come to no surprise that it can be applied to the context of fashion. Visual search for specific items of clothing and product recommendation systems have been developed for the market in recent years. There are a plethora of examples of this application in academia as well <a name=\"zakaryan\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#zakaryannote).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a plethora of examples of this application in both industry and academia. In one instance, Modista, a computer vision and machine learning based retail recommendation service, relies on the three features of shape, texture, and color to provide recommendations for similar shoes. In a study by Borras et al. through a UAB Bellaterra research paper “High-Level Clothes Description based on Colour-Texture and Structural Features”, the authors interpreted five clothing combinations in a graphical manner to try to deduce what someone was wearing in an inputted image. Both of these cases yield interesting insight into machine learning for fashion applications, but are fairly simple in nature <a name=\"khosla\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#khoslanote).\n",
    "\n",
    "More complex application involve the use of Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs), one such example comes from a Stanford research paper by Khosla and Venkataraman entitled “Building Image-Based Shoe Search Using Convolutional Neural Networks”.[1] CNNs are a popular form of neural networks used in image classification by using the mathematical property of convolution to simplify computations during model training. In this paper, Khosla et. al. struggled in regards to the nature of retrieval being inherently subjective in comparison to the classification (because there is no concrete definition for a shoe to be “similar” to another shoe). In the end, the authors found that they were able to improve over traditional computer vision and machine learning techniques through the use of their deep learning CNN architectures <a name=\"khosla\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#khoslanote)."
