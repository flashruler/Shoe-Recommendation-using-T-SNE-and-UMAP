# COGS118B Final Project

Our report can be found in the "Final Project Unsupervised Shoe Recommender System.ipynb" notebook. This notebook is a combined report taking images from the TSNE and UMAP notebooks where we conducted our experimentation as per class instructions.

The original notebooks where we did our individual T-SNE and UMAP implementations can be viewed in "TSNE_IMPLEMENTATION_AGGO.ipynb" and "UMAP_IMPLEMENTATION_AGGO.ipynb" respectively.

Forked from original repo hosted by Mabel Szeto for our COGS 118B class.
